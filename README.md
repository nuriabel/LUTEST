# LUTEST
Language Understanding Test Sets
Project PID2019-104512GB-I00 funded by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci√≥n (Spain).

LUTEST objective is the creation of test sets and an evaluation methodology that provide significant evidence about the linguistic generalization capabilities of deep learning methods applied to natural language processing.  For the last years, there have been different works on building test sets and evaluation methods for the purpose of assessing the language understanding capabilities of deep neural models and what information they select and encode. However, there is much work to be done yet, in particular from a linguistically-motivated perspective and for languages other than English.
